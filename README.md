# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
**Description:**
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for my Titanic Survival Prediction project. Using machine learning techniques, I have developed a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal of this project is to showcase the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to solve a real-world problem.

**Key Features:**

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and handled missing values in the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.

Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Employed different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict survival outcomes.

Evaluation Metrics: Utilized accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

Visualization: Created visualizations to gain insights into the data and showcase key findings.

Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed notebooks are provided to explain each step of the process.

The code and documentation in this repository serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in understanding how to approach a binary classification problem like Titanic Survival Prediction using machine learning. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or a seasoned data scientist seeking a practical example, this project provides valuable insights into data analysis and predictive modeling.

Feel free to explore the code, notebooks, and resources to gain insights into the world of machine learning and data analysis. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
