# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. By utilizing historical data, the project aims to create a model that accurately predicts passenger survival outcomes.
